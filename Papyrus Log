[03/30/2020 - 11:42:29AM] (Immersive HUD) See? That None object the error said could not be cast was in fact just cast and contained the widget I needed, and its element is: _root.WidgetContainer.0.widget. This seems to be an error in the Papyrus logging and should have no effect on your game. Please contact me if you believe otherwise. Thanks - Gopher
